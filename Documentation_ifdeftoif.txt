Documentation of ifdeftoif on sqlite3

24.11.2014 -- Problem with SQLITE_DEFAULT_MEMSTATUS
	SQLITE_DEFAULT_MEMSTATUS is not replaced. It is used as first element in struct sqlite3Config.
	After ifdeftoif, the struct is duplicated, but the first element is still "SQLITE_DEFAULT_MEMSTATUS".
	According to documentation it is a "0 or 1" option, so it should be a feature.
		/*
		** The SQLITE_DEFAULT_MEMSTATUS macro must be defined as either 0 or 1.
		** It determines whether or not the features related to 
		** SQLITE_CONFIG_MEMSTATUS are available by default or not. This value can
		** be overridden at runtime using the sqlite3_config() API.
		*/
	Perhaps this initialization is the key to why it does not work.
		#if !defined(SQLITE_DEFAULT_MEMSTATUS)
		# define SQLITE_DEFAULT_MEMSTATUS 1
		#endif
	I did an experiment. In the rest of the code SQLITE_DEFAULT_MEMSTATUS seems to be defined.
	Perhaps typeChef does not support using #if options as macros?
	Replaced 
		SQLITE_PRIVATE SQLITE_WSD struct Sqlite3Config sqlite3Config = {
			SQLITE_DEFAULT_MEMSTATUS,  /* bMemstat */ ...
	with 
		SQLITE_PRIVATE SQLITE_WSD struct Sqlite3Config sqlite3Config = {
			#if SQLITE_DEFAULT_MEMSTATUS==1
			1
			#else
			0
			#endif
			, ...
	Effect: We duplicate the struct. 
	def(SQLITE_DEFAULT_MEMSTATUS) means that SQLITE_DEFAULT_MEMSTATUS was set by the user (assuming to 0)
	!def(SQLITE_DEFAULT_MEMSTATUS) means that it was not set by the user and initialized to 1 by the above default initialization.
	(We are lucky that the value is not used before the default initialization. Otherwise the case where a user defined value 1 would be interpreted wrong.
